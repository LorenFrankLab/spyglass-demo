The Jupyter notebooks have been copied from <https://github.com/LorenFrankLab/spyglass> and a local DataJoint configuration created so that the notebooks work 'out-of-the-box' when used in conjuction with ephemeral the JupyterHub <https://spyglass.hhmi.cloud> managed by [2i2c](https://2i2c.org)

The image used to run the JupyterHub is located at: <https://quay.io/repository/lorenlab/hhmi-spyglass-image> and the source code for the image is located at <https://github.com/LorenFrankLab/hhmi-spyglass-image>.
